            Two Gods, Xul and Vordr, created this world and a Monolith on it in order to keep stable all the planes of existense. However, in front of the Monolith a big battle has started. One side consists of the people from the cities, who are trying to protect the Monolith, while the other side consists of barbarians from the mountains, who want to find a way to enter the Monolith, because according to a myth inside the Monolith the answers about everything in the universe exist. After an omen from Selune (details hidden) you decide to get closer to the Monolith, but the only way to get close enough is to get involved in the battle.
